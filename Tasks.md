# Tasks

- Implement the algorithm **GetGCD** for finding the GCD of two integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution. The solution to present in the form of a class library. 

- Implement the method **CountOfVowels** that return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, and **u** as vowels for this VowelCountTask. The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. The solution to present in the form of a class library. Do not use LINQ-queries to solve problem!

- Implement the method **OrderStringsByLength** that sorts the source array of strings in ascending order of their length. The solution to present in the form of a class library. Do not use LINQ-queries to solve problem!

- Implement the method **RemoveDuplicateWords** that removes all duplicate words from string, leaving only single (first) words entries. By word we shall mean the unit that consists only of latin alphabet characters. Only following punctuation marks (. , ! ? - : ; ) and space characters can be delimiters between words. The solution to present in the form of a class library. Do not use LINQ-queries to solve problem!
